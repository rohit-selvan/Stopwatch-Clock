# Stopwatch-Clock

This Python-based real-time clock application, built on the tkinter framework, offers a comprehensive solution merging digital clock functionality with a stopwatch feature. The application comprises two primary classes: RTC and ClockApp. The RTC class encapsulates the timekeeping logic, maintaining hours, minutes, and seconds while providing methods to increment time, start, stop, and reset the clock. Conversely, the ClockApp class manages the GUI elements, setting up a tkinter window displaying the current time, along with control buttons for starting, stopping, and resetting the clock. Moreover, the application seamlessly integrates a stopwatch functionality, allowing users to initiate, pause, and reset the stopwatch to accurately measure elapsed time intervals. By combining intuitive graphical controls with underlying timekeeping mechanisms, this application offers users an interactive platform to visualize time passage and measure durations accurately, showcasing the seamless fusion of a graphical user interface with functional time-related logic
